	  <p class="lead">The core concept with BT251 is that it divides one file in to various parts and make it accessible to any one who want to download part of the file, any who downloads different parts of the file from different sources can assemble different parts of the file and get the original file. The benefit of this approach is people can participate on the distribution of the file meaning everyone can be a music distributor and collect a reward for sending parts of the file. The following simulation shows how BT251 operates.</p>

	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p class="lead">Using BT251 We sale music based on the size, 1 song for about 80 (.8 ETB), then you get a 40 (.4 ETB) cents reward every time you seed the complete song.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="col-md-12">	  
	    <p class="lead">If you are The first 10 downloaders the download might be a little bit slow but it is guaranteed you get the highest reward available. For example : When 90 people download the torrent from The first 10 downloaders The first 10 downloaders get 5 x 9 = 45 Birr reward each. The price of 12 songs torrent is ~10 Birr and its reward value is ~5 Birr; if download is evenly distributed between The first 10 downloaders, that is each of the first 10 downloaders peers seed The torrent for 9 peers.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p class="lead">When another 900 downloaders buy the 12 music tracks torrent for 10 Birr there is 900 x 5 = 4,500 Birr reward available, then (The available reward 4,500) / (The first 10  downloaders + The first 90 downloaders) = 45 Birr each. At this point The first 10 downloaders got 90 Birr and The first 90 downloaders got 45 Birr each, from the music they bought for 10 Birr.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="col-md-12">	  
	    <p class="lead">The Big Picture is If There are ten torrent which are sold for 10 Birr each and they are downloaded 1 Million times each. We can say... </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="lead">The first 10 downloaders get 255 x 10 = 2,550 Birr From a 100 Birr Torrent</li>
	      <li class="lead">The first 100 downloaders get 180 x 10 = 1,800 Birr From a 100 Birr Torrent</li>
	      <li class="lead">The first 1,000 downloaders get 135 x 10 = 1,350 Birr From a 100 Birr Torrent</li>
	      <li class="lead">The first 10,000 downloaders get 90 x 10 = 900 Birr From a 100 Birr Torrent</li>

	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p class="lead">In-order for the first 1,000,000 downloaders to get paid, the 10 torrents needs to be downloaded 10 Million times each, if it doesn't, we say the torrent is saturated, hence it is not profitable and we assume you buy the torrent for the sake of enjoying the music.</p>

	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p class="lead">The best thing about BT251 is that you can start go a long way with out depositing cash, you can generate blocks inside the app in various ways. Blocks are used to buy a music, you get a Cash Reward in Birr for seeding the music</p>

		  It is not a pyramid scheme for the following reasons
		  <ul>
		    <li>
		      Pyramid scheme Emphasis on recruiting. BT251 is not recruiting we creating a  community.
		    </li>

		    <li>
		      In pyramid scheme No genuine product or service is sold. In BT251 we buy data and we sale content, the content can be a music, book, any digital content or even a stream.
		    </li>

		    <li>
		      Pyramid scheme promises of high returns in a short time period. In BT251 to be successful one has to seed continuously multiple torrents in that case it is very likely one can get a good return of investment.
		    </li>

		    <li>
		      Easy money or passive income. As I said in BT251 we buy data and we sale content that means you have spend your internet connection to get a reward from the sold content.
		    </li>
		    
		    <li>
		      In Pyramid commission structure is complex. In BT251 you get commission only when you seed the  content.

		  If you can mention which steps makes it like a pyramid scheme I would like to emphasize on it. Remember not all networks are pyramid scheme, but pyramid scheme a network. For example in pyramid scheme there is an unlimited nesting of reward for example in pyramid scheme there is a given chain namely A → B→ C → D→ E;  A gets reward when B, C, D, E sold a useless product, B gets reward when C, D, E sold a useless product, C reward when D, E sold a useless product and; … even if A did not participate on the sales activity of the useless product for C, D, and E he still gets a commission that is what makes it a pyramid scheme, In BT251 for a given chain A → B → C→ D → E; A gets a commission from only purchase of B because that is where sh/e spent their internet connection. B get gets paid only from the purchase of C. and remember in BT251 all A, B, C, D and E buy an awesome digital content that they enjoy.

		   I am a software engineer, and an entrepreneur and I am not a licensed distributor. But remember BT251 is intended to eliminate illegal distribution of copyrighted content by rewarding seeders. I respect other peoples creative work because I my self is a software developer, and the laws are there too protect the artist from distributors who does not share the revenue with the artist, BT251 in on the other hand shares revenue with the artist. The only difference between a legal distributor and an illegal distributor is the question ‘do they share sales revenue with the original author or not’, hence technically BT251 is not an illegal distributor because we share sales revenue with the artist, the only thing BT251 lacks is the legal framework and if things went really really bad with the artist there are levels of penalties we are prepared to accept. and remember the artist’s revenue from BT251 is better than any currently available distributors in Ethiopia or even YouTube, Spotify or iTunes.

		  Yes Tiens provide goods and service, I believe they claim they supply foods for astronauts (which I would like to take with a grain of salt), other pyramid schemes also sale shady products like a course, but when you look deeper the course is about how to sale the course. BT251 sales awesome content which any one is willing to buy even when there is no BT251; and In BT251 we sale 2 MB mp3 file for ~ 20 Cents. A key identifier for a pyramid scheme is people who do not participate in a particular sales processes gets a paid a lot because of the pyramid structure, in BT251 people who do not participate on a particular seeding session do not get paid, because BT251 has a Peer to Peer structure.

		   In the creation of BT251 the start-up no one is left behind, every one gets rewarded based on the amount of work they done (sharing the app), for example if I sheared a link for you and you install the app and shaded it and you get a 100 app installed only you can get the 100 app install reward, I only get 1 app install reward if it is only you who installed the app using my link. And in BT251 (the network) people get reward when they seed the content they bought from the network, remember  the content is a valuable work of a given artist not some kind of useless content.

		  As I have stated earlier BT251 will be launched when someone brings 100 app downloads using the link in the app; after the first 100 app downloads on Google Play Store, BT251 will have a a legal frame work to operate in Ethiopia.
		  <mark>And by the way in Ethiopian law emails, chats, posts and other digital contents can be used as forensic evidence, that means everything I put on the internet about BT251 could be used to enforce my claims. i.e. if I did not send the revenue from the content to the artist, or if I do not establish the company as a share or Plc up on the arrival of the first person who has 100 app installs and give 2% of BT251 to the first 100 in install provider.</mark>

		  The first reason I did not want to host it on my own server is because it is very hard if not impossible to protect a copyrighted content online and offline. Online copyright content protection needs a specialized server infrastructure like YouTube or TikTok. My second reason is In Ethiopia most  content creators are not able squeeze every last drop their creative work because production companies can not protect the content on the internet, on blue tooth or transfer. We came up with a solution to track illicit content transfer which is to create some kind of reward system that enables the bearer of the content to get rewarded when sending to others; that way a User can buy new music for less money, the artist get a the most possible revenue and the sender get a reward.

	    <p class="mb-0">bt251.com don't get discouraged at some comments. Such people will always be around and are just good signs of the progress you are making. Even if you are not a company, the negative people here should have encouraged you for the great work which they most probably have no idea about and suggest you to form a company instead of making trash comments like "I have super powers". I am just commenting to encourage the great work you are trying to achieve. Your kind of people will in the end win and that's what we want for the poor country we are living in..</p>

Great comment. The negative attitude from some people here is so cringe. Bt251.com demonstrated that the scheme is not pyramid as it doesn't traverse more than one level. Plus when he started the discussion he asked for a comment and areas to improve and people began insulting him. It is not identical to this, but even the reputed podcasters like Lex Friedman would ask their audience to buy a product from a website by putting their names so the consumer gets a discount and support the podcast. The guy might even need an idea how to establish his company and how to contact the artists. Why not try to encourage him and positively correct? He came up with a novel idea. Big ups to you bt251.com</p>

	    <p class="mb-0">Personally I don't think it's ponzi scheme. But I believe there are somethings which needs to be adjusted. I see some wrong lanes. It's always better spending more time than actual development on research, study and discussions when you launch a new business model specially in Ethiopia.</p>
